A full-featured web application designed to streamline the management of vehicle spare parts across multiple user roles. The system provides dedicated dashboards for Admins, Managers, Suppliers, and Users, ensuring smooth operations, organized workflows, and efficient data handling.

This system allows organizations to manage their entire spare parts workflow—from inventory and suppliers to customer orders and sales reports. Each role is given clear responsibilities through dedicated modules and role-based access.

I developed the **Supplier Management Module**, which enables suppliers to seamlessly interact with the system. Key features include:

* Adding new spare parts along with specifications and pricing

This module ensures smooth coordination between the supplier and the rest of the system, enhancing the workflow and keeping inventory accurate and updated.
